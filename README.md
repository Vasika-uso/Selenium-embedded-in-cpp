So this is the awarding script
 ... atm i think it should change the upvote 
 button xpath for each post ...
 so im gonna make a gui for it i think
 
 awarded 20+ awards but it is extremely slow
 so idk if its gonna be profitable
 or something i think of making the vpn
 for each userdata so it would
 do like multithreading
 on regions for faster awarding
